# Case Study: Analyzing the Hubble Tension with CDS

## Abstract
The discrepant measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the early universe (CMB) and the late universe (local distance ladder) constitute one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. This case study demonstrates the use of the **Cognitive Discovery Platform (CDS)** to generate potential physical resolutions, manage observation data, and quantify the statistical significance of the tension.

## 1. Problem Statement
Measurements from the Planck satellite (CMB) suggest $H_0 \approx 67.4 \pm 0.5 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$, while local observations using Type Ia supernovae (SH0ES) yield $H_0 \approx 73.0 \pm 1.4 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$. The resulting $\sim 5\sigma$ tension suggests either undetected systematic errors or physics beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model.

## 2. Hypothesis Generation
We use the `cds.hypothesis` module to explore theoretical extensions that could bridge this gap. By supplying the research question to the hypothesis generator, we can systematically categorize potential resolutions.

```python
from cds.hypothesis import generate_hypotheses, Domain

# Formulate the research inquiry
inquiry = "What physical mechanisms could resolve the Hubble tension between CMB and SN Ia measurements?"

# Generate falsifiable hypotheses
hypotheses = generate_hypotheses(
    research_question=inquiry,
    domain=Domain.COSMOLOGY,
    n=3
)

for h in hypotheses:
    print(f"Hypothesis: {h.statement}")
    print(f"Predictions: {h.predictions}")
    print(f"Confidence: {h.confidence}\n")
```

*Example Output:*
- **Early Dark Energy (EDE):** A transient component of dark energy in the early universe increases the pre-recombination expansion rate, reducing the sound horizon.
- **Modified Gravity:** Decaying dark matter or interacting dark energy alters the late-time expansion history.

## 3. Data Management and Analysis
Using `cds.data_analysis.DataSet`, we can load and manipulate cosmological datasets. In this snippet, we simulate measurements from two different observational regimes to prepare for statistical comparison.

```python
import random
from cds.data_analysis import DataSet

# Mock data generation based on reported observational means and uncertainties
# Late Universe (e.g., SH0ES/SN Ia)
late_data = [{"h0": random.gauss(73.0, 1.4), "source": "SH0ES"} for _ in range(100)]
# Early Universe (e.g., Planck/CMB)
early_data = [{"h0": random.gauss(67.4, 0.5), "source": "Planck"} for _ in range(100)]

ds_late = DataSet(late_data)
ds_early = DataSet(early_data)

# Extracting columns for analysis
h0_late = ds_late.column("h0")
h0_early = ds_early.column("h0")

print(f"Loaded {len(ds_late)} late-universe observations.")
print(f"Loaded {len(ds_early)} early-universe observations.")
```

## 4. Quantifying the Tension
To rigorously assess whether the discrepancy is statistically significant, we employ Welch's t-test via `cds.stats.two_sample_ttest`. This accounts for potentially unequal variances between the two measurement methods.

```python
from cds.stats import two_sample_ttest

# Perform two-sample t-test (Welch's t-test for unequal variances)
result = two_sample_ttest(h0_late, h0_early, equal_var=False)

print(f"T-statistic: {result.statistic:.4f}")
print(f"Degrees of Freedom: {result.df:.2f}")
print(f"P-value: {result.p_value:.2e}")

if result.p_value < 1e-5:
    print("Conclusion: The tension is statistically significant (p < 1e-5).")
```

## 5. Conclusion
The CDS framework lets researchers move from high-level theoretical exploration to data validation in a single environment. By combining automated hypothesis generation with statistical tools, we can approach the Hubble tension systematically and evaluate the viability of new physics.
