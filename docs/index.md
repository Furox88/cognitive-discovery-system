# Cognitive Discovery Platform (CDS)

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Cognitive Discovery Platform (CDS)**.

CDS is an open-source computational science platform designed for research, simulation, and discovery. It provides a lightweight, dependency-free environment for scientific exploration, featuring 15 modules covering everything from quantum simulation to automated hypothesis generation.

## Key Features

- **Pure Python:** Every module is implemented from scratch using the Python standard library. No heavy dependencies like NumPy or SciPy required.
- **Quantum Simulation:** Full state-vector simulation for single and multi-qubit circuits with entanglement and O(1) sampling.
- **Advanced Mathematics:** O(N³) Partial Pivoting LU decomposition, vectorized optimizers, and adaptive ODE solvers (RK45).
- **Hypothesis Engine:** Built-in tools for generating and statistically validating scientific hypotheses.
- **High Reliability:** 570 tests with 100% code coverage.
- **Interactive Tools:** Beautiful CLI and a Streamlit-based web dashboard.
