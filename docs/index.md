# Cognitive Discovery System (CDS)

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Cognitive Discovery System (CDS)**.

CDS is an open-source computational science platform designed for research, simulation, and discovery. It provides a lightweight, dependency-free environment for scientific exploration, featuring 18 modules covering everything from quantum simulation to symbolic math, knowledge organization, educational NLP primitives, and automated hypothesis generation.

## Key Features

- **Pure Python:** Every module is implemented from scratch using the Python standard library. No heavy dependencies like NumPy or SciPy required.
- **Quantum Simulation:** Full state-vector simulation for single and multi-qubit circuits with entanglement and O(1) sampling.
- **Advanced Mathematics:** O(N³) Partial Pivoting LU decomposition, vectorized optimizers, and adaptive ODE solvers (RK45).
- **Hypothesis Engine:** Built-in tools for generating and statistically validating scientific hypotheses, complemented by effect-size measures (Cohen's d, Cramér's V) that quantify the magnitude of an effect alongside its significance.
- **High Reliability:** Comprehensive test suite with 100% code coverage (statement + branch) on the reference CI cell. See the CI and codecov badges in the [README](https://github.com/Furox88/cognitive-discovery-system) for the live test count and coverage.
- **Interactive Tools:** Beautiful CLI and a Streamlit-based web dashboard.
