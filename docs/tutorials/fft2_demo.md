# 2-D FFT Tutorial

`cds.signals` extends its from-scratch Fourier toolkit to two dimensions with
`fft2` / `ifft2` (row-column Cooley-Tukey) — pure Python, no NumPy.

## 1. Forward transform of a small image

A 4×4 "image" is just a list of rows. `fft2` returns the complex spectrum of
the same shape.

```python
from cds.signals import fft2

image = [
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],
    [2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0],
    [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
    [4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0],
]

spectrum = fft2(image)
```

The DC component `F[0][0]` equals the sum of all pixels:

```
DC component (sum of all pixels):
  F[0][0] = 64.0  (expected 64.0)
```

The magnitude spectrum shows where the signal's energy lives. For a smooth
ramp like this, almost everything is concentrated at low frequencies:

```
Magnitude spectrum |F[u][v]|:
   64.00   11.31    8.00   11.31
   11.31    0.00    0.00    0.00
    8.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
   11.31    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

## 2. Inverse transform (round-trip)

`ifft2` inverts the transform. The reconstruction error against the original
image is machine-precision:

```python
from cds.signals import ifft2

recovered = ifft2(spectrum)
max_err = max(
    abs(recovered[i][j].real - image[i][j])
    for i in range(4)
    for j in range(4)
)
print(f"Max reconstruction error: {max_err:.2e}")
#   Max reconstruction error: 0.00e+00
```

## When to use it

2-D FFTs power classic image-processing tasks: filtering (low/high-pass in
the frequency domain), convolution (via the convolution theorem), and
compression (energy compaction). CDS keeps the implementation readable so you
can follow exactly how rows then columns are transformed.
