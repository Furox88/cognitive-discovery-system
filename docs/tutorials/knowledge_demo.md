# Knowledge Organization Tutorial

`cds.knowledge` is a self-contained subsystem for organising research knowledge: a **knowledge graph** of named concepts connected by typed, directed relations, a **notebook** of free-form notes linked to concept names, and **ranked structured retrieval** across both. Everything is pure Python (stdlib `json` for persistence) and decoupled from `cds.graph`, whose dense integer-vertex model is a poor fit for named concepts with typed relationships.

## 1. Build a Concept Graph

Concepts are named nodes with optional description, tags, and metadata. Relations are typed, directed edges (`source --kind--> target`).

```python
from cds.knowledge import KnowledgeGraph

kg = KnowledgeGraph(name="Cosmology")
kg.add_concept(
    "Dark Energy",
    description="Energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.",
    tags=["cosmology", "energy"],
    metadata={"first_proposed": "1998"},
)
kg.add_concept("Hubble Constant", tags=["cosmology", "measurement"])
kg.add_concept("Cosmic Microwave Background", tags=["cosmology", "radiation"])

kg.add_relation("Dark Energy", "Hubble Constant", kind="affects")
kg.add_relation("Hubble Constant", "Cosmic Microwave Background", kind="constrains")
```

Relations are **directed** — `"A depends-on B"` is not symmetric — but the traversal helpers below follow edges in either direction when that's what you want.

## 2. Traverse the Graph

```python
print(kg.neighbors("Hubble Constant"))
# ['Dark Energy', 'Cosmic Microwave Background']  (undirected)

print(kg.neighbors_out("Dark Energy"))   # ['Hubble Constant']   (outgoing only)
print(kg.neighbors_in("Cosmic Microwave Background"))
# ['Hubble Constant']  (incoming only)

print(kg.find_path("Dark Energy", "Cosmic Microwave Background"))
# ['Dark Energy', 'Hubble Constant', 'Cosmic Microwave Background']

print(sorted(kg.reachable("Dark Energy")))   # transitive closure (undirected)
print(kg.find_cycles())                       # directed cycles, normalized
```

`find_path` and `reachable` use BFS and traverse edges in either direction, so a path may run against a relation's direction. `find_cycles` works on the *directed* structure and reports each cycle once, normalized to start at its smallest member — deep graphs are safe because it uses an explicit stack rather than recursion.

You can filter neighbors by relation type:

```python
print(kg.neighbors("Hubble Constant", kind="constrains"))
# ['Cosmic Microwave Background']
```

## 3. Keep a Notebook of Notes

A `Note` is a free-form record (title + body + tags) that links to concept names by **string**, not by reference — so a note may mention a concept that isn't in any graph yet, exactly like a citation in a lab book.

```python
from cds.knowledge import Notebook

nb = Notebook(name="Cosmology Lab Book")
nb.add_note(
    note_id="n1",
    title="Hubble Tension",
    body="Local and CMB measurements of H0 disagree at ~5 sigma.",
    tags=["experiment", "tension"],
    linked_concepts=["Hubble Constant", "Cosmic Microwave Background"],
    created="2024-03-12",
)

print([n.id for n in nb.notes_for_concept("Hubble Constant")])  # ['n1']
print([n.id for n in nb.notes_by_tag("experiment")])            # ['n1']
```

## 4. Ranked Retrieval

`search` ranks matching concepts and notes by a simple, deterministic, explainable score: an exact name/title match is `1.0`, a substring match in the description/body/title is `0.5`, and ties break alphabetically.

```python
from cds.knowledge import search

for hit in search(kg, nb, query="hubble"):
    kind = "concept" if hit.concept_name else "note"
    ident = hit.concept_name or hit.note_id
    print(f"[{kind}] {ident}  score={hit.score}  matched_on={hit.matched_on}")
# [concept] Hubble Constant  score=0.5  matched_on=name
# [note] n1                 score=0.5  matched_on=title
```

Use `search_concepts(kg, query)` or `search_notes(nb, query)` to search one store at a time. Any of the three accepts an optional `tag=` filter.

## 5. Persist to JSON

Every entity serializes via `to_dict` / `from_dict`, and the owning graph and notebook read/write JSON via the stdlib.

```python
kg.save("cosmology.json")
reloaded = KnowledgeGraph.load("cosmology.json")
print(len(reloaded.concepts), len(reloaded.relations))  # 3 2
```

Both `KnowledgeGraph` and `Notebook` validate their input on load and raise `ValueError` on malformed data, so corrupted files fail loudly rather than silently.

## Rendering

For quick inspection or for pasting into a report, both collections render to Markdown:

```python
print(kg.to_markdown())      # structured list of concepts + relations
print(nb.to_markdown())      # compact index of notes
print(nb.get_note("n1").to_markdown())  # a single self-contained note
```
