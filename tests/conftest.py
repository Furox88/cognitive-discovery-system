"""Shared pytest fixtures for the CDS test suite.

These fixtures centralize object construction that was previously copy-pasted
across test modules (``test_hypothesis.py``, ``test_core.py``, and others), so
the tests can focus on behavior instead of boilerplate construction.

Scope rules
-----------
- ``function`` (default) is used for everything that could be mutated by a
  test, so each test gets a fresh instance and cannot leak state into the next.
- ``session`` would only be safe for truly immutable, expensive-to-build
  objects; nothing here qualifies, so every fixture stays ``function``-scoped.

    re-stating the seven required arguments every time.
