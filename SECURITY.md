## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | Notes |
|---------|--------------------|-------|
| 1.3.x   | Yes                | Stable; current release line (use ≥1.3.1 for working `cds` CLI) |
| 1.2.x   | Yes                | Stable; previous minor line, security fixes only |
| 1.1.x   | No                 | EOL (superseded by the 1.3.x + 1.2.x window) |
| 1.0.x   | No                 | EOL |
| < 1.0   | No                 | EOL (0.9.x beta, 0.8.x alpha, and earlier are unsupported) |

Stable releases (1.0.0+) follow a stricter support window: the current minor version plus the 1 previous minor version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue.**

Instead, email the maintainer directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
- GitHub: https://github.com/Furox88/cognitive-discovery-system/security/advisories/new

We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 7 days.

## Threat Model

`cognitive-discovery-system` is a pure-Python scientific computing library distributed via PyPI.
The threat model below describes what we consider in scope and out of scope.

### In Scope

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Supply chain: malicious dependency** | `requirements.lock` and `requirements-dev.lock` pin exact versions; CI builds run on every push and PR; Dependabot opens weekly PRs for outdated dependencies. |
| **Supply chain: malicious release artifact** | PyPI releases uploaded solely via the `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow (the sole publish authority), triggered by a `v*` tag push; `scripts/publish.py` builds, tests, verifies, and pushes the tag locally but never touches PyPI directly. Each release attaches the sdist + wheel to a GitHub Release; GitHub Actions `attest-build-provenance@v2` produces a sigstore attestation that any consumer can verify. |
| **Code execution from package install** | Build backend is `hatchling` (no setup.py execution); versioning is static (`version` in `pyproject.toml`, mirrored in `src/cds/_version.py`), so no runtime version derivation executes on install. |
| **Untrusted input in scientific functions** | All numerical kernels are pure-Python implementations; no `eval`/`exec` of user input; CLI (`cds` command) uses Typer with strict parsing. |
| **Dependency confusion** | PyPI project name `cognitive-discovery-system` is unique; the import name `cds` is short enough to be susceptible but we document it in the README. |

### Out of Scope

| Threat | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| **Denial of service** | This is a research/education library; DoS via crafted input is acceptable. |
| **Side-channel attacks on numerical code** | Pure-Python timing is dominated by interpreter overhead; side channels are not exploitable in practice. |
| **Confidentiality of user data** | The package does not collect, store, or transmit user data. |
| **Cryptographic implementation correctness** | The package uses Python's `hashlib` and `secrets` via the standard library where applicable; it does not implement custom crypto. |

### Known Limitations

- **Pure-Python performance**: Large inputs (e.g., Monte Carlo with N>10⁷) can be slow and may leak timing information about input size. For sensitive workloads, use a dedicated numerical library.
- **No formal verification**: Numerical kernels are tested against known reference values but not formally verified. Use at your own risk for safety-critical applications.
- **Single-maintainer project**: Response time for security reports depends on the maintainer's availability (typically < 7 days).

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Pin versions**: Always pin `cognitive-discovery-system==X.Y.Z` in `requirements.txt` rather than using `>=` or unpinned ranges.
2. **Verify releases**: For high-assurance environments, verify the sigstore attestation on the GitHub Release against the published wheel/sdist hashes.
3. **Keep dependencies fresh**: Run `pip install --upgrade` regularly; Dependabot PRs are opened weekly.
4. **Audit lockfiles**: `requirements.lock` and `requirements-dev.lock` are committed; diff them on every PR to spot unexpected changes.
