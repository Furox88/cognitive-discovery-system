"""Digital IIR/FIR filters — Butterworth design and order-statistic denoising.

Extends the Fourier-domain tools in :mod:`cds.signals.processing` with classic
filter *design* and time-domain *application*. The Butterworth family is built
from scratch via the analog prototype + bilinear-transform recipe (the same
derivation scipy uses), so the coefficients are reproducible without any third-
party dependency. Band-pass and band-stop responses are realised as cascaded /
paralleled low- and high-pass sections, which keeps the maximally-flat -3 dB
edges exact while remaining numerically well-conditioned for hand-rolled
difference-equation evaluation.

All routines are pure Python with no external dependencies.
