"""
cognitive-discovery-system

Pure Python computational science system for research, simulation,
and scientific discovery.

Key features:
- Zero heavy dependencies (pure Python)
- Quantum simulation (single & multi-qubit with entanglement)
- Signal processing (FFT, 2D FFT, convolution, filtering)
- Optimization, statistics, probability, linear algebra
- Hypothesis generation for structured research ideas
- CLI for quick calculations and discovery workflows

All modules are designed to be readable, testable, and usable
for education, research, and custom scientific discovery workflows.

Usage:
    import cds
    print(cds.__version__)
