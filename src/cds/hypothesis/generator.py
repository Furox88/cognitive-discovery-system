"""
Scientific hypothesis generator for the Cognitive Discovery System.

This module turns research questions into structured, falsifiable
hypotheses with clear assumptions and predictions.

It provides ready-to-use prompt templates and a simple offline
generator for demos and testing. The HypothesisGenerator Protocol
makes it straightforward for researchers to supply their own
generator implementations for specialized workflows.

Key goals:
- High-quality, reusable prompt templates for scientific reasoning
- Clean separation between templates and generation logic
- Simple Protocol for custom generator implementations
- Usable offline as a starting point

See the HypothesisGenerator protocol and examples for how to
provide a custom generator.
