"""
Hypothesis generation and evaluation module for Cognitive Discovery.

Provides tools to generate structured scientific hypotheses from
research questions. Includes prompt templates and an offline
generator for immediate use, plus a clear Protocol for supplying
custom generator implementations for specialized research needs.

The focus is on making hypotheses falsifiable, with explicit
assumptions, predictions, and confidence estimates.

Example:
    from cds.hypothesis import generate_hypotheses

    hypos = generate_hypotheses(
        "Why do we observe the Hubble tension?",
        domain="cosmology",
        n=3
    )
